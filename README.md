## Hi, I am Luca 👋

I am a Backend developer 💻 and I like to code in Java mainly, but with my last work experience, I started to work a lot also with Javascript and a personalized xml language.
<!---
I enjoy building software that I actually use in my life like an expenses manager app (⬇ more below...) or a scraper to buy used goods at the best price (coming soon for you to enjoy 😊). If I'm not sitting in a desk coding away, you'll find me reading or going deep in absolutely useless topics until three in the morning 😂.
